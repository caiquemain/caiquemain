### Hi there, I'm [Caique Main](https://github.com/caiquemain) 👋

### Glad to see you here! 😄

I'm a technology enthusiast, a Computer Science and Data Science student, and a gamer at heart 🎮. My passion for programming 💻 started early, at just 11 years old, during a school project. After a stint in Civil Engineering, I realized my true calling was technology, and today I'm deeply immersed in data and code.

I believe problem-solving is the essence of my work. I love unraveling complex challenges and transforming ideas into solutions that truly make a difference in people's lives. My goal is always to create something that brings joy and optimization to everyday routines.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring worlds in games like **Drakengard**, **Nier**, and **Dark Souls** – I'm a huge fan of these epic narratives! Currently, I'm even developing a personal project related to **Genshin Impact** 🌟. Beyond gaming, I'm passionate about traveling ✈️ and learning new things in the tech universe.
